            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr>
            </center>
            <p>The healthcare industry has been a pioneer in the application of decision support or
expert systems capabilities. Even though the area of medical informatics and decision
support has been around for more than four decades, there is no formal definition for a
medical decision support system. Wyatt & Spiegelhalter (1991) describes a medical
decision support system as a computer-based system using gathered explicit knowledge
to generate patient specific advice or interpretation. The healthcare industry has
witnessed a phenomenal growth and advances both in the areas of practice and research.
This rapid growth of medical science has made the practice of medicine both challenging
and complex. To address these challenges, the recognized medical standards organizations developed medical practice guidelines to simplify the research findings to practical
applications in order to improve the overall healthcare quality and delivery. Despite such
initiatives, it has been difficult for the physicians to keep up with the guidelines and to
tune it to their practice settings. A clear gap began to develop between developing of
practice guidelines and the implementation of the same. Grimshaw and Russell (1993)
identified that the knowledge dissemination and implementation strategies are critical to
the impact the developed guidelines will have on the physician behavior.</p>
            <p>The natural evolution was to develop paper-based decision support workflow or
protocols. Paper-based decision support models were developed and are widely used at
most physician practices to apply the guidelines into practice. Paper-based decision
support models, while effective, are also error prone. For example, dose recommendation
models could require tedious calculations and can be error prone when performed
manually. Such errors could defeat the purpose of using a decision support model. Also,
paper-based models require education and training to the personnel performing those
calculation and require an additional layer to review the calculations. Most paper-based
models are used by the medical personnel as a batch work flow process.</p>
            <p>Thus computer-based decision support systems were developed to provide accurate
guideline compliance and to enhance physician performance (Hunt, Haynes, Hanna, &
Smith, 1998). Computerized decision support system can be extremely valuable for
treatment or diagnosis support and compliance accuracy when used at the point of care
(Lobach & Hammond, 1997). This feature of computerized medical decision support
system is a key differentiator that makes the paper-based decision support models
inferior. A well designed computerized medical decision support system can be used to
provide patient specific support at the desired time and location with the adequate
content and pace. When decision support systems are blended into the day-to-day
practice workflow, these systems have the potential to function as a valuable assistant
and also as an educational tool (Thomas, Dayton, & Peterson, 1999).</p>
            <p>The computerized decision support systems make decisions based on the clinical
practice guidelines. Clinical practice guidelines are the rule-based knowledge that guides
the decision makers in a medical setting. These guidelines have been developed over the
years to reduce the variations among medical practices with a common goal to provide
cost effective and high quality healthcare services (Field & Lohr, 1992). The availability
of several decision support systems and the use of common knowledge and rules
triggered the need for a common method of sharing the knowledge. This technique can
</p>
            <p>save the cost of developing the same medical practice guidelines for multiple decision
support systems.</p>
            <p>While it is common among organizations to share the data and information between
computer systems, sharing the knowledge was a challenge. The medical arena rose to the
occasion and various associations were involved in development of a standard way of
sharing the medical knowledge and clinical practice guidelines among systems. After

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <hr>
            </center>
            <p>The invention of computers resulted from the dream of creating an electronic brain. This
quest to artificial intelligence has driven several technological advances in various
industries. The potential of intelligence and decision support in the area of medicine was
set forth more than four decades ago by Lusted and Ledley (1959). While several
computer systems have been developed to improve the administrative efficiency and
medical records access, the significant challenges have always been in the development
of medical decision support systems. Knowledge-based decision support systems
acquire, formalize, and store the expert knowledge in a computer system and infer the
represented knowledge in a problem area by modeling the decision process of experts.</p>
            <p>One of the first expert systems developed is in the field of medicine. This expert system
called MYCIN, provides decision support to physicians on treatment related advices for
bacterial infections of the blood and meningitis. The basic structure of the MYCIN expert
system is to present a question and answer dialog to the physician. After collecting the
</p>
            <p>basic information about the patient, it asks about the suspected bacterial organisms,
suspected sites, presence of relevant symptoms, laboratory results and recommends the
course of antibiotics (Buchanan & Shortliffe, 1984). Even though this was a primitive
expert system, it brought out the power of such decision support tool in the area of
medicine and the potential for more growth in the area of artificial intelligence in medicine.
After the introduction of MYCIN in the field of medicine, various decision support
systems were introduced and have been successfully used. The commonly used decision
support techniques in medical decision support systems are intelligent agents, rulebased engines, heuristics, and decision algorithms</p>
            <p>The use of an intelligent agent or softbot (intelligent software robot) is a popular decision
support technique that has the potential to become one of the most important in the next
decade (Turban & Aronson, 2000). There are several definitions of an intelligent agent,
but the general concept is that the agent carries out a set of operations with some degree
of autonomy (Murch & Johnson, 1999). To perform these tasks, an intelligent agent
should contain some knowledge. The key characteristics of an intelligent agent are that
it should be autonomous, goal-oriented, collaborative, and flexible (Brenner, Zarnekow,
& Wittig, 1998). For example, an appropriate task for an intelligent agent would be to use
a patient’s history and problem list to assist the physician with diagnostic coding during
the order entry process.</p>
            <p>A heuristic is a rule of thumb that is used primarily to arrive at a “good enough” solution
to a complex problem. This technique is used primarily when input data are limited and
incomplete. When the problem or the reality is extremely complex and optimization
techniques are not available, a heuristic may be used. Heuristics do not yield definitive
solutions, but assist decision makers in arriving at provisional solutions (Camms &
Evans, 1996). For example, the determination of the choice of initial doses of both
medication and dialysis treatment for a renal patient relies on population-based pharmacokinetic and solute kinetic heuristics, respectively. Subsequent dosing does not require
heuristic reasoning, but may be calculated on the basis of measurements of the individual
patient’s response to the initial dose (Raghavan, Ladik, & Meyer, 2005).</p>
            <p>Rule-based decision support systems primarily store knowledge in the form of rules and
problem solving procedures. In expert systems, the knowledge base is clearly separated
from processing. Inputs may come from the user, or may be collected from various other
programs. Rules are applied on the data collected using an inference engine, decisions
are suggested, and explanations supplied (Turban & Aronson, 2000). For example,
DARWIN, a renal decision support system, uses rule-based reasoning to advise dialysis
technical staff regarding the response to bacteriologic monitoring of fluids used during
hemodialysis. Another example of a rule-based or expert system is the use of clinical
protocols to generate suggestions regarding anemia treatment using erythropoietin and
iron protocols. On the basis of knowledge of new and historical laboratory results and
medications, the expert system can suggest the modification of drug doses or the
discontinuation of a medication. The inference engine can also provide an explanation
of the basis of the recommendation in the protocol.</p>
            <p>A decision algorithm is a set of instructions that is repeated to solve a problem. Highly
intelligent algorithms include the capability to learn and to perform several iterations of
the algorithm or of parts of the algorithm until an optimal solution is reached (Turban &
</p>
            <p>Aronson, 2000). A very simple decision algorithm may alert physicians on receipt of outof-range laboratory results. If the decision algorithm verifies the patient’s history and
decides if the standard abnormal range is indeed abnormal for the patient, the algorithm
can be classified as an intelligent decision algorithm.</p>
            <p>In the next sections, we will discuss about the characteristics of a medical decision
support systems, generic components, problem areas in which decision support systems
are used and knowledge sharing standards.</p><br>

            <h2>Characteristics of Medical<br>
Decision Support Systems          </h2>
            <hr>
            </center>
            <p>To understand the characteristics of a medical decision support system, it is important
to analyze the medical decision making process. A clear understanding of the medical
decision making process is essential to appreciate the value and the characteristics of
a medical decision support system. Decision making in medicine is not a single point
event. It is an extremely complex sequence of inter related and differentiated activities
that occur over a period of time. The vastness of the knowledge area presents itself
infinite paths to reach a decision. Thus, the importance of finding an optimal path is
extremely important in the decision making process. Any assistance in this critical step
can be of immense value to the medical decision makers. Hastie (2001) identifies three
components to a decision making process. The first component is the choice of options
and courses of actions. The second is the beliefs and opinions about the objective states,
and the processes including input and outcomes states. The third is the values and
consequences attached to each outcome of the event-choice-action combination.</p>
            <p>The decision support literature classifies problems into three major categories: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (Gorry & Morton, 1971). Structured problems
are routine and repetitive: solutions exist, are standard, and pre-defined. Unstructured
problems are complex and fuzzy; they lack clear and straight-forward solutions. Semistructured problems combine the features of the two previous categories; their solution
requires human judgment as well as the application of standard procedures (Simon, 1971).</p>
            <p>Thus the complexity involved in a decision making process can be grouped as a
knowledge gathering process, knowledge storage, knowledge retrieval, and information
processing. The literature categorizes the decision making process into four distinct
phases: intelligence, design, choice, and review (Stohr & Konsynski, 1992).</p>
            <p>During the intelligence phase of the decision making process, the need for a decision
making (or the trigger) event is recognized and the clinical problem or opportunity is
properly identified and defined. This is done by eliciting two different types of knowledge
domains: public and private. Private knowledge generally is heuristic and experiencebased knowledge that usually comes from the clinical practitioners. Public knowledge
can be gathered from standards, guidelines, text books and journals. The office of
technology assessment (1995) suggests usage of the following questions in identifying
the problems and opportunities for medical decision support.
